Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array from the lowest value to the highest value

Bubble sort works by,
1. Going through the array one value at a time
2. For each value, it compares the value with the next value
3. If the value is higher than the next one, the values are swap so the highest value comes last
4. Go through the arrays as many times as there are values in the arr
